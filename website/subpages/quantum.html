      <p>
        Quantum mechanics differs from the standard model in 3 main ways. <br />
        <br />
        1. Quantities are restricted to discrete values (quantization) <br />
        2. Objects have both wave and particle properties (wave-particle
        duality) <br />
        3. There are limits to the accuracy with which one can predict physical
        properties prior to its measurement given its initial state.
        (uncertainty principle) <br />
        <br />

        Instead of showing exactly where something is, such as an electron in a
        hydrogen atom, a quantum mechanical representation of the hydrogen atom
        gives probabilities of where the electron could be, without stating
        where exactly the electron is. Quantum mechanics came from the solutions
        to problems which could not be solved using classical mechanics, such as
        Albert Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect which showed a
        relationship between energy and frequency. The modern quantum model was
        largely created by Erwin Schrödinger, Louis de Broglie, and Werner
        Heisenberg.
