  <h3>The Quantum Model</h3>
  <img class="mainimg" src="../media/quantum.png"/>
  <p>
    Quantum mechanics differs from the standard model in 3 main ways. 
  </p>
  <div class="numbered-list">
    <p>1. Quantities are restricted to discrete values (Quantization)</p>
    <p>2. Objects have both wave and particle properties (wave-particle duality)</p>
    <p>3. There are limits to the accuracy with which one can predict physical properties prior to its measurement given its initial state. (Uncertainty principle)</p>
  </div>
