    <h3>The Quantum Model</h3>
    <img class="mainimg" src="../media/quantum.png" />
    <p>Quantum mechanics differs from the standard model in 3 main ways.</p>
    <div class="numbered-list">
      <p>1. Quantities are restricted to discrete values (Quantization)</p>
      <p>
        2. Objects have both wave and particle properties (wave-particle
        duality)
      </p>
      <p>
        3. There are limits to the accuracy with which one can predict physical
        properties prior to its measurement given its initial state.
        (Uncertainty principle)
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Instead of showing exactly where something is, such as an electron in a
      hydrogen atom, a quantum mechanical representation of the hydrogen atom
      gives probabilities of where the electron could be, without stating where
      exactly the electron is.
