      <h2>JOHN DALTON (1808)</h2>
      <img src="../media/people/dalton.png" />
      <p>
        John Dalton was an English schoolteacher, chemist and meteorologist. He
        is often credited with introducing the modern atomic theory into
        chemistry, as well as his research on color blindness, a condition which
        affected him. His work included the formulation of Law of Partial
        Pressures (Dalton’s Law) and the Law of Definite Proportions. He was
        born on September 6, 1766 in Eaglesfield, England, and died on July 27,
        1844 (aged 77) in Manchester, England.

      <h3>Contributions to Atomic Theory</h3>
      <p>
        John Dalton’s contributions to the atomic theory built upon the
        principles put forward by Democritus, thousands of years before. Dalton
        also believed that all matter was composed of tiny, indestructible
        atoms, with different atoms bonding to form different compounds and
        substances. He discovered that all atoms of the same element were
        identical in mass and size, but the mass and size of an atom varied
        between elements. He also uncovered the fact that atoms could not be
        created or destroyed. Dalton believed that atoms of different elements
        could be distinguished based on their atomic weights, and proceeded to
        calculate the weights of various atoms, as well as the bonding
        structures of compounds. The relative weights of atoms became known as
        the Law of Definite Proportions, in which Dalton used the hydrogen atom
        as a reference to weigh other atoms against. He first recorded his
        findings in a scientific article in 1803, then consolidated them in his
        book <i>A New System of Chemical Philosophy</i>, published in 1808.

      <h3>Solid Sphere Model</h3>

      <p>
        Dalton’s atomic model depicted the atom as a solid sphere, much like a
        billiard ball. The atoms of a single element would be identical in mass
        and size, but atoms of different elements would vary. However, Dalton’s
        model had many limitations, as it did not account for electric charge
        and energy, and could not explain how compounds and atomic bonds were
        formed (what makes element A and B’s atoms bond, but not element X and
        Y). Furthermore, Dalton hypothesized that chemical compounds could only
        be created from chemical reactions and combining elements in
        whole-number ratios, leading him to believe that water was HO, instead
        of the H<sub>2</sub>O we recognize today.
