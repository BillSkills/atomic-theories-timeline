      <h2>JOHN DALTON</h2>
      <img src="../media/dalton.png" />
      <p>John Dalton was an English schoolteacher, chemist and meteorologist. He is often credited with introducing the modern atomic theory into chemistry, as well as his research on color blindness, a condition which affected him. His work included the formulation of Law of Partial Pressures (Dalton’s Law) and the Law of Definite Proportions. He was born on September 6, 1766 in Eaglesfield, England, and died on July 27, 1844 (aged 77) in Manchester, England.</p>

      <h3>Contributions to Atomic Theory</h3>
      <p>
        John Dalton’s contributions to the atomic theory built upon the principles put forward by Democritus, thousands of years before. Dalton also believed that all matter was composed of tiny, indestructible atoms, with different atoms bonding to form different compounds and substances. He discovered that all atoms of the same element were identical in mass and size, but the mass and size of an atom varied between elements. He also uncovered the fact that atoms could not be created or destroyed. Dalton believed that atoms of different elements could be distinguished based on their atomic weights, and proceeded to calculate the weights of various atoms, as well as the bonding structures of compounds. The relative weights of atoms became known as the Law of Definite Proportions, in which Dalton used the hydrogen atom as a reference to weigh other atoms against. He first recorded his findings in a scientific article in 1803, then consolidated them in his book A New System of Chemical Philosophy, published in 1808.
