      <p>
        Born on October 20, 1891 in Bollington, Cheshire, England, Sir James
        Chadwick was a British physicist. He is credited with the discovery of
        the neutron in 1932, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics
        in 1935. In 1941, he wrote the MAUD Report, a report on the feasibility
        of atomic weapons. This report inspired the United States government to
        work on atomic weapon technology. Chadwick was the head of the British
        team on the Manhattan Project, working on nuclear weapons. He was
        knighted for his achievements in physics in 1945.

      <h3>Contributions to Atomic Theory</h3>
      <p class="contributions">
        Under the leadership of Ernest Rutherford, James Chadwick discovered the
        neutron in 1932 at Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. Using
        radioactive polonium, he shot an alpha particle into beryllium, which
        absorbed the radiation, and became carbon, but also created another
        particle. It was originally believed that this other particle was
        actually gamma radiation, but when Chadwick measured this new particle,
        he found it had no charge but the same mass as a proton. This particle
        was the neutron, and Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in
        1935 for his discovery.
