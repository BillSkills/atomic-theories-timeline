      <p>
        Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger was born August 12, 1887, in
        Vienna, Austria-Hungary. He was an Austrian-Irish physicist, and he
        primarily worked in quantum theory. He is famous for the Schrödinger
        Equation, which allows one to calculate the wave function of a system.
        He also worked in physics, thermodynamics, statistical mechanics,
        general relativity, electrodynamics, and cosmology. In addition, he made
        several attempts to create a unified field theory. His “Schrödinger’s
        Cat” thought experiment is well known in popular culture and was first
        proposed after extensive correspondence with Albert Einstein.

      <h3>Contributions to Atomic Theory</h3>
      <p class="contributions">
        Erwin Schrödinger worked on the new quantum theory, writing about atomic
        theory and the theory of atomic spectra. In 1922, he geometrically
        analyzed the orbits of electrons, and found that quantum orbits had some
        geometric properties. This discovery helped pave the way for some parts
        of wave mechanics. In 1926, Schrödinger wrote a paper in which he
        presented his ‘Schrödinger Equation’, and gave its derivation. This
        paper is considered one of the most important papers of the 20th
        century. He wrote a second paper just 4 weeks later, which solved some
        additional quantum problems and gave a new derivation of the Schrödinger
        Equation. Later, he published a third paper, in which he showed that his
        approach was equivalent to that of Karl Heisenberg. In a fourth paper,
        he created a ‘complex’ solution to the wave equation, which eventually
        allowed him to reduce the order of the equation to 1. This showed that
        quantum mechanics was a ‘complex’ system, rather than a ‘real’ one.
