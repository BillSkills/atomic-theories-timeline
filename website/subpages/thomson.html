  <h3>Sir Joseph John Thomson</h3>

  <p>
    Sir Joseph John Thomson was a British physicist accredited with the discovery of the electron. He was awarded the
    Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 for his research on the conduction of electricity by gases. Born in Manchester,
    England on December 18, 1856, Thomson conducted both theoretical and experimental work regarding subatomic
    particles, with his most famous work being the cathode ray tube experiment. He was knighted in 1908 by King Edward
    VII, and received many medals and accolades pertaining to his scientific research throughout his career. He passed
    away in Cambridge, England on August 30, 1940, at the age of 83.

  <h4>Contributions to Atomic Theory</h4>
  <p>
    Thomson began studying cathode rays in 1894, the science behind which was not yet fully known. Cathode rays are
    glowing beams of light which follow an electrical discharge in a high vacuum tube. Thomson devised equipment and
    methods to better analyze the cathode ray, in what is now known as the cathode ray tube experiment. Upon his return
    from America, where he had been giving lectures on his research at Princeton University, Thomson achieved the
    discovery of the electron. By measuring the angle at which the cathode rays were deflected, Thomson was able to
    calculate the ratio of electrical charge to the mass of the particles. He discovered that the ratio was identical
    regardless of the gas used, which led him to believe that there was a universal particle that was smaller than the
    atom. He called these particles ‘corpuscles’, although the term ‘electron’ coined by Irish physicist George
    Johnstone Stoney in 1891 was more widely adopted in later science. Thomson continued to work on electrical charges,
    with his notable experiment with neon in 1912 proving the existence of isotopes in a stable element.

  <h4>Plum Pudding Model</h4>
  <p>
    J. J. Thomson created an atomic model which described the atom as a spherical cloud of positive charge, balancing
    the negatively charged electrons contained within it. Plum pudding is often used as an analogy, with the ‘plums’
    representing the electrons embedded in the atom. Despite Thomson’s use of real world experiments to back up his
    claims, his model still had limitations; it conflicted with the results of Rutherford’s gold foil experiment and
    still could not explain atomic bonding.
