      <p>
        Werner Karl Heisenberg was born on December 5, 1901, in Würzburg,
        Kingdom of Bavaria, German Empire, and was a German theoretical
        physicist, working primarily on quantum mechanics. He wrote several
        papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, both German physicists and
        mathematicians, and is most well known for his uncertainty principle,
        which he published in 1927. In 1932, Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel
        Prize in Physics for ‘the creation of quantum mechanics’, after being
        nominated by Albert Einstein in 1928. Besides his contributions to
        quantum mechanics, Heisenberg is known to have worked on the dynamics of
        turbulent flows, cosmic rays, subatomic particles, and the atomic
        nucleus. He was one of the main scientists working on the German nuclear
        weapons program in WWII. After the war, Heisenberg played an important
        role in planning the first West German nuclear reactor.

      <h3>Contributions to Atomic Theory</h3>
      <p class="contributions">
        Heisenberg worked with Hans Kramers on a paper on dispersion, or the
        scattering of radiation from atoms where the wavelength of the radiation
        is larger than the atom. Kramers had come up with a successful formula,
        but the paper showed it could not be based on Bohr orbits. Heisenberg
        eventually solved this problem, but when he had the paper reviewed by
        Max Born, Born recognized that the formulas could be transcribed into a
        system of matrices. Born, and his assistant Pascual Jordan worked to
        transcribe the formula, and published it. Later that year, the three men
        worked together on a follow-on paper to combine their work. Heisenberg
        went on to work on quantum theory. In contrast to Louis de Broglie and
        Albert Einstein, 'realists' who believed that all particles had a true
        momentum and position at all times, Heisenberg was an 'anti-realist',
        and argued that we can only describe particles, but we can’t know their
        'true' position and momentum. This idea led to what is now known as the
        Hesienberg Uncertainty Principle, the idea that there is a certain
        amount of precision with which we can observe or predict particles, but
        there are still many possibilities of the particle’s properties.
