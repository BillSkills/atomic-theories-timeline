  <h3>Werner Karl Heisenber (1930-)</h3>

  <p>
    Werner Karl Heisenberg was born on December 5, 1901, in Würzburg, Kingdom of Bavaria, German Empire, and was a German theoretical physicist, working primarily on quantum mechanics. He wrote several papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, both German physicists and mathematicians, and is most well known for his uncertainty principle, which he published in 1927. In 1932, Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for ‘the creation of quantum mechanics’, after being nominated by Albert Einstein in 1928. Besides his contributions to quantum mechanics, Heisenberg is known to have worked on the dynamics of turbulent flows, cosmic rays, subatomic particles, and the atomic nucleus. He was one of the main scientists working on the German nuclear weapons program in WWII. After the war, Heisenberg played an important role in planning the first West German nuclear reactor.

  <h4>Contributions to Atomic Theory</h4>
  <p>
    Heisenberg worked with Hans Kramers on a paper on dispersion, or the scattering of radiation from atoms where the wavelength of the radiation is larger than the atom. Kramers had come up with a successful formula, but the paper showed it could not be based on Bohr orbits. Heisenberg eventually solved this problem, but when he had the paper reviewed by Max Born, Born recognized that the formulas could be transcribed into a system of matrices. Born, and his assistant Pascual Jordan worked to transcribe the formula, and published it. Later that year, the three men worked together on a follow-on paper to combine their work. Heisenberg went on to work on quantum theory. In contrast to Louis de Broglie and Albert Einstein, “realists” who believed that all particles had a true momentum and position at all times, Heisenberg was an “anti-realist”, and argued that we can only describe particles, but we can’t know their “true” position and momentum. This idea led to what is now known as the Hesienberg Uncertainty Principle, the idea that there is a certain amount of precision with which we can observe or predict particles, but there are still many possibilities of the particle’s properties.
