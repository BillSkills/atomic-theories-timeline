      <h2>DEMOCRITUS (400 BC)</h2>
      <img src="../media/people/democritus.png" />
      <p>
        Democritus was an Ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher, most
        recognized for his development of the principles of atomic theory. He
        was born in around 460 BC in Abdera, Thrace, and died circa 370 BC (aged
        ~90). Known to many as the ‘laughing philosopher’ for his cheerfulness
        throughout his philosophies, he is considered a highly influential
        figure in establishing modern science. Although none of his supposed 73
        works have been recovered in full, many fragments of his writing have
        survived, and were often cited by later philosophers such as Aristotle.

      <h3>Contributions to Atomic Theory</h3>
      <p>
        Democritus developed the theory of atomism in collaboration with his
        mentor Leucippus, who was known to have influenced Democritus’s work,
        although little information exists on Leucippus himself. They believed
        that all matter is composed of miniscule, eternal particles, which vary
        in shape and size. They called these particles <i>atomos</i> (Greek for
        uncuttable/indivisible), a word which was later derived into the modern
        term ‘atom’. These indivisible particles exist in a void, an infinite
        vacuum which contains an infinite number of particles, thus making up
        the entire physical world. Democritus also believed that atoms were
        constantly moving and colliding with each other, and collisions of
        different atoms led to the creation of different objects and substances.
