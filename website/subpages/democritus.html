  <h3>Democritus</h3>

  <p>
    Democritus was an Ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher, most recognized for his development of the principles of
    atomic theory. He was born in around 460 BC in Abdera, Thrace, and died circa 370 BC (aged ~90). Known to many as
    the ‘laughing philosopher’ for his cheerfulness throughout his philosophies, he is considered a highly influential
    figure in establishing modern science. Although none of his supposed 73 works have been recovered in full, many
    fragments of his writing have survived, and were often cited by later philosophers such as Aristotle.

  <h4>Contributions to Atomic Theory</h4>
  <p>
    Democritus developed the theory of atomism in collaboration with his mentor Leucippus, who was known to have
    influenced Democritus’s work, although little information exists on Leucippus himself. They believed that all matter
    is composed of miniscule, eternal particles, which vary in shape and size. They called these particles atomos (Greek
    for uncuttable/indivisible), a word which was later derived into the modern term ‘atom’. These indivisible particles
    exist in a void, an infinite vacuum which contains an infinite number of particles, thus making up the entire
    physical world. Democritus also believed that atoms were constantly moving and colliding with each other, and
    collisions of different atoms led to the creation of different objects and substances.
