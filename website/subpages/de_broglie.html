  <p>
    Born Louis Victor Pierre Raymond, 7th Duc de Broglie on August 15 1892 in Dieppe, France, Louis de Broglie was an
    aristocrat and physicist who made great contributions to quantum theory. For his PhD thesis, he worked on the
    concept of the wave nature of electrons and suggested that all types of matter have wave-like properties, now known
    as the “de Broglie Hypothesis”, and is an example of wave-particle duality, an important part of quantum mechanics.
    De Broglie won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929 after his hypothesis was demonstrated experimentally in 1927. His
    work was later used by Erwin Schrödinger in his work on wave mechanics.

    <h4>Contributions to Atomic Theory</h4>
    <p>
      In 1924, de Broglie wrote his thesis “Recherches sur la théorie des quanta (Research on the Theory of the
      Quanta)”,
      in which he introduced his theory of electron waves. His work included the wave-particle duality theory of matter,
      which was based on the work of Albert Einstein and Max Plank. His research resulted in the de Broglie hypothesis
      saying that “any moving particle or object had an associated wave.” With this, de Broglie had created the field of
      wave mechanics, which unites the physics of energy in the form of waves, and matter in the form of particles.
      Later
      in his career, he worked on a causal explanation of wave mechanics, opposing the probabilistic interpretations of
      quantum mechanics.
