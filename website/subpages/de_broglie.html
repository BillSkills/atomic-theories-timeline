        Born Louis Victor Pierre Raymond, 7th Duc de Broglie on August 15, 1892
        in Dieppe, France, Louis de Broglie was an aristocrat and physicist who
        made great contributions to quantum theory. For his PhD thesis, he
        worked on the concept of the wave nature of electrons and suggested that
        all types of matter have wave-like properties, now known as the ‘de
        Broglie Hypothesis’, and is an example of wave-particle duality, an
        important part of quantum mechanics. De Broglie won the Nobel Prize for
        Physics in 1929 after his hypothesis was demonstrated experimentally in
        1927. His work was later used by Erwin Schrödinger in his work on wave
        mechanics.

      <h3>Contributions to Atomic Theory</h3>
      <p class="contributions">
        In 1924, de Broglie wrote his thesis “<i
          >Recherches sur la théorie des quanta (Research on the Theory of the
          Quanta)</i
        >”, in which he introduced his theory of electron waves. His work
        included the wave-particle duality theory of matter, which was based on
        the work of Albert Einstein and Max Planck. His research resulted in the
        de Broglie hypothesis saying that “any moving particle or object had an
        associated wave”. With this, de Broglie had created the field of wave
        mechanics, which unites the physics of energy in the form of waves, and
        matter in the form of particles. Later in his career, he worked on a
        causal explanation of wave mechanics, opposing the probabilistic
        interpretations of quantum mechanics.
