    <h3>Ernest, Baron Rutherford of Nelson</h3>

    <p>
      Ernest Rutherford (Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson) was
      a New Zealand-born British physicist often known as the ‘father of nuclear
      physics’. He studied radioactivity, discovering the concept of radioactive
      half-life, the radioactive gas radon, and classifying alpha and beta
      particles as distinct forms of radiation. He was awarded the 1908 Nobel
      Prize in Chemistry for his research. His famous gold foil experiment, as
      well as his development of the nuclear model of the atom, heavily
      influenced the research and discoveries of later physicists and
      scientists, including James Chadwick, Niels Bohr, and Otto Hahn.
      Rutherford was born on August 30, 1871, and died October 19, 1937 (aged
      66).

    <h4>Contributions to Atomic Theory</h4>
    <p>
      In 1895 Rutherford began to study at University of Cambridge’s Cavendish
      Laboratory, where he worked under Professor J. J. Thomson on a study of
      x-rays. Thomson went on to discover the electron, while Rutherford
      researched ion-producing radiations. He noticed that uranium placed near
      foil resulted in one type of radiation being blocked, but another type
      easily penetrated the foil. He labeled these two types of radiation
      ‘alpha’ and ‘beta’, later proving that alpha particles were identical to
      helium nuclei, and that beta particles were simply electrons or positrons.
      Rutherford left Cambridge in 1902, at which point he took up a
      professorship at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. At McGill, he
      collaborated with Yale Professor Bertram Borden Boltwood in categorizing
      radioactive elements into a “decay series”, as well as discovered the
      radioactive gas radon. In 1909, he directed physicists Hans Geiger and
      Ernest Marsden in conducting his now famous gold foil experiment, the
      results of which disproved the Thomson’s widely accepted atomic model. In
      the gold foil experiment, alpha particles were shot through a thin gold
      foil, which was surrounded by a screen coated in zinc sulfide. Most alpha
      particles passed through the foil with little to no deflection, but a
      noticeable fraction were deflected by more than 90 degrees, with about 1
      in 2000 particles being scattered a full 180 degrees. This led Rutherford
      to develop his atomic model, which is still fairly accurate today.

    <h4>Nuclear Model</h4>
    <p>
      In Rutherford’s nuclear model, the atom is described as mostly empty
      space, with a positively charged nucleus in the center which makes up
      majority of the atom’s mass. Electrons moving in orbits surround the atom,
      and are held to the nucleus through electrostatic forces of attraction.
      However, although Rutherford’s model improved upon Thomson’s model, it
      still had flaws; the model could not account for stable elements and
      projected all atoms to collapse due to electrons spiralling into the
      nucleus as they lost energy. Although no longer the most accurate,
      Rutherford’s model diagram is still often symbolically used to represent
      science in popular culture.
