  <h3>Ernest, Baron Rutherford of Nelson</h3>

  <p>
    Ernest Rutherford (Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson) was a New Zealand-born British physicist often
    known as the ‘father of nuclear physics’. He studied radioactivity, discovering the concept of radioactive
    half-life, the radioactive gas radon, and classifying alpha and beta particles as distinct forms of radiation. He
    was awarded the 1908 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research. His famous gold foil experiment, as well as his
    development of the nuclear model of the atom, heavily influenced the research and discoveries of later physicists
    and scientists, including James Chadwick, Niels Bohr, and Otto Hahn. Rutherford was born on August 30, 1871, and
    died October 19, 1937 (aged 66).

  <h4>Contributions to Atomic Theory</h4>
  <p>
    In 1895 Rutherford began to study at University of Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory, where he worked under Professor
    J. J. Thomson on a study of x-rays. Thomson went on to discover the electron, while Rutherford researched
    ion-producing radiations. He noticed that uranium placed near foil resulted in one type of radiation being blocked,
    but another type easily penetrated the foil. He labeled these two types of radiation ‘alpha’ and ‘beta’, later
    proving that alpha particles were identical to helium nuclei, and that beta particles were simply electrons or
    positrons. Rutherford left Cambridge in 1902, at which point he took up a professorship at McGill University in
    Montreal, Quebec. At McGill, he collaborated with Yale Professor Bertram Borden Boltwood in categorizing radioactive
    elements into a “decay series”, as well as discovered the radioactive gas radon. In 1909, he directed physicists
    Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden in conducting his now famous gold foil experiment, from which Thomson’s atomic model
    was disproved and the Rutherford model was developed.
