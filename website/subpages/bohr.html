      Born on October 7, 1885 in Copenhagen, Denmark, Niels Henrik David Bohr
      was a Danish physicist and philosopher. Bohr worked in theoretical
      physics, studying atomic structure and quantum mechanics. Niels Bohr
      received the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physics, as well as many other accolades
      for his work. He is well known for his eponymous atomic model, which
      addressed the flaws of the Rutherford model at the time. Bohr’s family was
      Jewish, which forced him to escape to Sweden during WWII, shortly after
      which he flew to the United States to work on the Manhattan Project in the
      development of nuclear weapons. After the war, Bohr returned to Europe to
      advocate for research on peaceful applications of nuclear technology.
      Niels Bohr died in Copenhagen on November 18, 1962 (aged 77).

      Bohr received his master’s and doctorate degree in physics from Copenhagen
      University in 1911. He traveled to Cambridge to pursue his theoretical
      studies, following the guidance of Sir J. J. Thomson. However, he was
      ultimately unable to impress Thomson with his experiments, and in 1912
      went to conduct post-doctoral work at the University of Manchester with
      Ernest Rutherford. Shortly after his return to Denmark in 1912, Bohr began
      teaching at Copenhagen University as a docent. In 1913, Bohr published
      three papers in Philosophical Magazine, outlining the basis of his atomic
      theories. Bohr had explored Rutherford’s atomic model, and by borrowing
      concepts from Max Planck’s quantum theory, he developed the Bohr model.
      Rutherford’s model could not explain stable atoms, as the electrons were
      expected to lose energy and crash into the nucleus. Bohr researched the
      work of physicists John William Nicholson, Johann Balmer and Johannes
      Rydberg, who studied spectroscopy and performed atomic spectra
      experiments. His research, paired with quantum theory, led him to believe
      that electrons existed in discrete orbits around the nucleus, and that
      electrons could gain or lose energy by jumping from one orbit to another.
      The energy that electrons lost was given off in the form of
      electromagnetic radiation. This solved the stable atom problem that the
      Rutherford model encountered, as electrons could now orbit the nucleus
      without constantly emitting energy, and thus not spiral into the nucleus.
