      <h2>NIELS BOHR (1913)</h2>
      <img src="../media/people/bohr.png" title="Niels Henrik David Bohr" />
      <p>
        Born on October 7, 1885 in Copenhagen, Denmark, Niels Henrik David Bohr
        was a Danish physicist and philosopher. Bohr worked in theoretical
        physics, studying atomic structure and quantum mechanics. Niels Bohr
        received the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physics, as well as many other
        accolades for his work. He is well known for his eponymous atomic model,
        which addressed the flaws of the Rutherford model at the time. Bohr’s
        family was Jewish, which forced him to escape to Sweden during WWII,
        shortly after which he flew to the United States to work on the
        Manhattan Project in the development of nuclear weapons. After the war,
        Bohr returned to Europe to advocate for research on peaceful
        applications of nuclear technology. Niels Bohr died in Copenhagen on
        November 18, 1962 (aged 77).

      <h3>Contributions to Atomic Theory</h3>
      <p class="contributions">
        Bohr received his master’s and doctorate degree in physics from
        Copenhagen University in 1911. He traveled to Cambridge to pursue his
        theoretical studies, following the guidance of Sir J. J. Thomson.
        However, he was ultimately unable to impress Thomson with his
        experiments, and in 1912 went to conduct post-doctoral work at the
        University of Manchester with Ernest Rutherford. Shortly after his
        return to Denmark in 1912, Bohr began teaching at Copenhagen University
        as a docent. In 1913, Bohr published three papers in Philosophical
        Magazine, outlining the basis of his atomic theories. Bohr had explored
        Rutherford’s atomic model, and by borrowing concepts from Max Planck’s
        quantum theory, he developed the Bohr model. Rutherford’s model could
        not explain stable atoms, as the electrons were expected to lose energy
        and crash into the nucleus. Bohr researched the work of physicists John
        William Nicholson, Johann Balmer and Johannes Rydberg, who studied
        spectroscopy and performed atomic spectra experiments. His research,
        paired with quantum theory, led him to believe that electrons existed in
        discrete orbits around the nucleus, and that electrons could gain or
        lose energy by jumping from one orbit to another. The energy that
        electrons lost was given off in the form of electromagnetic radiation.
        This solved the stable atom problem that the Rutherford model
        encountered, as electrons could now orbit the nucleus without constantly
        emitting energy, and thus not spiral into the nucleus.

      <h3>Planetary Model</h3>

      />
      <p>
        Bohr created his model of the atom as an analogue for the solar system,
        with the nucleus in the center represented as the sun and electrons
        orbiting it as planets. Electrons could only move from one orbit/shell
        to another, unable to go between orbits. When electrons gained energy,
        they moved to a higher/further outward energy shell, and vice versa.
        However, Bohr’s model still had limitations, in that it only displays
        the orbits in two dimensions, whereas the actual atomic structure was
        more complex.
