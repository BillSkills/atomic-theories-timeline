find good images for the work/experiments that your four guys did (prob equations or diagrams or something) and put them in the /media/experiments folder as .png files

cite the images, paste the citations in the references.html file at the very bottom (follow the format I used, two <br /> tags)

go to the following files:
    de_broglie.html, schrodinger.html, heisenberg.html, chadwick.html

scroll down to <!-- DO THIS -->
    make the <img> tag point to the image you put in the folder
    put in a title attribute for the image
    remove the <!-- DO THIS --> comment
